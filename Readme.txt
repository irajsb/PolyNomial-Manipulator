To run the app download .exe file in debug folder .
To see the codes just tap any file that u want to see in folder.
Examples that my teacher gave me

(+2.34-1.34)(+3.14)
(-x+1)(+x+1)  
(+3.14x1-1)(+1.000x1) 
(-21x2+4.2x1+1.25)(+1)(+x)
(-x+1)(+x)(+x+1)
standard form example: (+1x2+3x1-4x)(2x3+3x1-7x9)(+1x2+3x1-4x)(2x3+3x1-7x9)
U can simply add any other forms of polynomials by 
if(string=="form u want"){
code that converts to standrad form;
}
//u have to use iterators
